# 🚀 Scalable Multi-Agent LLMOps System  
**_Leveraging Groq LPU, Tavily Search, LangGraph, FastAPI, Streamlit, SonarQube, Jenkins, and AWS Cloud Deployment_**

![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture.png)

---

## 📘 Overview
This project is an **end-to-end, production-ready Multi-Agent LLMOps System** designed for scalable, automated AI agent deployment and management.  
It integrates **Groq LPU** for high-speed inference, **Tavily Search** for real-time web reasoning, and **LangGraph** for multi-agent orchestration — all powered by **FastAPI**, **Streamlit**, and a complete **CI/CD pipeline** with **Jenkins**, **SonarQube**, and **AWS Fargate**.

## ⚙️ Workflow Summary

### 1️⃣ Agent Development & Core Logic
- Multi-agent orchestration via **LangGraph**
- Agents perform reasoning and data retrieval using **Tavily API**
- **Groq LPU** delivers lightning-fast inference and model execution

### 2️⃣ Service & Interface Layer
- **Backend:** `FastAPI` exposes RESTful and streaming endpoints
- **Frontend:** `Streamlit` dashboard provides real-time interaction and monitoring

### 3️⃣ CI/CD & Deployment
- **Jenkins** automates build and deploy pipelines
- **SonarQube** ensures code quality with bug and vulnerability scanning
- **Docker** containers are built and pushed to **AWS ECR**
- **AWS Fargate** runs the containers serverlessly
- **AWS Load Balancer** manages traffic and scalability
