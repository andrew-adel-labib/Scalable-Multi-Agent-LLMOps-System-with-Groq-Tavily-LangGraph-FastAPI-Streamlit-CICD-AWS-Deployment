# üß† Scalable Multi-Agent LLMOps System

### Leveraging Groq LPU, Tavily Search, LangGraph, FastAPI, Streamlit, SonarQube, and AWS Cloud Deployment

**Full Technical Name:**
**End-to-End Multi-Agent LLMOps System Leveraging Groq LPU Inference, Tavily Search Integration, LangGraph Orchestration, FastAPI Backend, Streamlit Frontend, and a CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, AWS ECR, AWS Fargate, and Load Balancer for Scalable Cloud Deployment.**

---

## üåç Overview

This project is a **Multi-Agent LLMOps System** built as a **full-stack, production-ready AI orchestration platform** designed for scalable and automated deployment.

It integrates **Groq** for ultra-fast LLM inference, **Tavily** for real-time web search augmentation, and **LangGraph** for multi-agent orchestration‚Äîall wrapped in a robust **FastAPI** backend and an interactive **Streamlit** frontend.

The system is part of an advanced **LLMOps/AIOps pipeline**, focusing on performance, code quality, automation, and cloud scalability. The CI/CD process uses **Jenkins**, **SonarQube**, **Docker**, **AWS ECR**, and **Fargate** for automated deployment. An **AWS Load Balancer** ensures reliability and traffic efficiency.

## üîÅ Project Workflow Summary

### üß© 1. Agent Development and Core Logic

* **Agent Design:** Specialized AI agents (e.g., Research Agent, Code Generation Agent) built using **LangGraph** to model complex reasoning workflows.
* **Tool Integration:** Agents use **Tavily Search** or external APIs for dynamic, knowledge-augmented reasoning.
* **LLM Inference:** Powered by **Groq LPU** for high-speed inference with low latency.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Service and Interface Layer

* **Backend:** Built with **FastAPI**, exposing REST and streaming endpoints.
* **Frontend:** Created with **Streamlit** for real-time user interaction and visualization.

### üöÄ 3. LLMOps / CI/CD Pipeline

* **Continuous Integration:** Managed by **Jenkins**, integrating with **SonarQube** for quality gates.
* **Containerization:** Application packaged via **Docker** for consistency.
* **Cloud Deployment:**

  * **AWS ECR:** Stores container images.
  * **AWS Fargate:** Runs serverless containers.
  * **AWS Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic and ensures scalability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Deployment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/andrewadel/multi-agent-llmops-system.git
cd multi-agent-llmops-system

# Build Docker image
docker build -t multi-agent-llmops .

# Run FastAPI service
docker run -p 8000:8000 multi-agent-llmops
